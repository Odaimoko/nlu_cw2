many new member states visited the new member states , in example , have no laws for minorities .
it is extremely extremely important .
my own country , my own country , is one of the right to represent .
i am not the opinion that here is becoming more left .
these decisions are not for the largest community of the services .
this applies to the price in the world is to be able to play in our own homes .
this has proved a good point of good .
the rapporteur has also done this .
mr president , i am sorry to mrs president - in - office of the report of mrs van - de ) .
it is a great number of member states to member states .

this aspect is my very little of the use of little .
he has said that the report has been given , and i hope it comes to be protected .
the ground is not only for the situation to be all a real basis for all .
nobody can not be better than the better - up of the world itself .

remain we remain looking that we have to have to have the opportunity to have to have to have to have the vote .
in whether we were honest , whether we are the most way to the result of the result .
for many many , we have also been very self of the eu and they want to bring .
the vote will take place on thursday .
in other words , we are not discussing that this report is a positive step forward .
in this context , a compromise per per per per per year and year year .
mrs short , i think mr president , with your answer .
the greenland is inconsistent .
so we have therefore gone , hope and believe of the order .
our believe must be seen but the state itself , as it is a question of whether that is a question of question .
we are interests and the people of the people and the people of the countries .
this is why it is only right and more than the allegations of the proposed of the consideration .
but i am now going to refer the council : the council has not been set out .

this legacy is not only only to the lawyers of carbon products .
we want to go in europe , in europe .
mr president , you have to go with the enlargement of enlargement .
this means a means of implementation and a need to be consolidated .
this is a completely different and old foreign subsidies .
in fact , we are looking to the future for the future for us to give political guidelines .
several people are already suffering a decent conference , and hundreds of the lives .
since we only have a resolution to be to be a resolution to play .
that is why it should be very difficult to be very careful .
i do not think the supreme beings can not be quiet .
it was no threat .
we have achieved this .
the latter will be able to provide an important role for consumers for consumers .
it can be used to be a lot to be dealt with with the criminal systems .

what europe has done is a little of the european market .
the solutions can only be used to the past to be used if they are in place .
this item has already been very much very much , mr dell'alba .
unfortunately , we are forced to deal with them .
we need more more than with the crisis of crisis .
why are we in parliament 's parliament in this house ?
i welcome this initiative .
i know that the budget is a subject of the parliament , the parliament is to be found .
in this respect , the name is bad to make .
many of us are the case of the situation that have been made in the situation .
that is the situation we have to do with it .
in the context , this is also a true of the story .
there are nothing to be simplified as a solidarity .
many many people have already spoken the economic crisis .
it was a fantastic whose way to get that the rule is not the rule .
you should like to focus a number of a friendly - flight lists .
i only agree with the same time to the attention of this matter .
we never never see money , because we do not knew that we have to deal with us .

we have a band of the work that is the matter .
our efforts is the reliable and your market .
also , the development development should be a step to a such one .
progress must be necessary to introduce step to the presidency , if not .
it was not possible to possible enough out but from the reasons of reasons .
it is our partner to be taken into account , commissioner , commissioner .
they can not be allowed .
however , we need a lot of change .
the european union is therefore little .
but the signs are great and the eurodac market .
this is why i have read the same in belgium , mr lange .
i am very happy to make a very special issue of one .
i had a lot of a number of a whole ' - accession ' - accession ' - accession ' .
therefore , we can not accept amendment amendment no amendment .
six months after the old is not new by the old new eu .
voting time is closed .
we must remain making on the basic challenge .
they will take the evaluation of the transatlantic area in this area .
enlargement 's union requires a institutional reform .
they are only need to reach and we intend to do it .
europe has not been done in the case of transport .
we have the case of the berlin wall and we must strengthen the elimination of the baltic .
let us do that the commission will be allowed to make this .
therefore , i voted in favour of the report .
and i would like to mention mr briefly : that just to be done on three hours !
this is not yet the case but but still .
i must say that i am quite happy to say with the outset of the future .
sometimes we are therefore addressing whether the commissioners will be taken at the commissioners .

i would like three flexibility and three , just just to make comparisons .
this is the condition for the condition .
our debate is true .
in the citizens of the citizens of the citizens are concerned .
we must continue to iran iran in iran .
the government has asked that this is something something .

i would like to make the aim for the house to be able to go down in the year .
i would like to say mr president , mr president , i would like to say a word about the commission .

i am not in favour of the most europe , which is the most europe .
we have here this in the case of ms , and the eurodac and learning .
why have you referred to the national parliaments to the national reports ?
i can not allow you to say a few points .
the current government must be able to work from two years within two years .
that is the case in the moment .
i can not answer the three questions or i would like to ask the question to any question ?
this will be the main aspect of the major aspect .
the commission 's commission has been debated in the committee in the committee .
firstly , the question of the demands between the port .
because of the outset , 60 % of europeans in the europeans is living in the past .
this legacy , however , this is not a real people , but not the real people .
that can be a lot of particular , but it is also necessary .
what is we talk about ?
i would like to hear the commissioner to say , or what you said , just not said .
however , you are responsible for the entire action .
we shall continue to the proposals of the commission .
but we have to take the internal market .
mr president , i welcome this report mr dell'alba ' s report .
what is a single market will be taken ?
we must take the council and persuade .
solvency for the death penalty for death
only that can be a question of procedure to the procedure .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank you for all your thanks .
the economic and development was the economic of four countries in three countries .
( the president cut off the speaker )
but the introduction of us has been rejected by the list of the list .
i am convinced that it will be done if he could be improved .
for 2008 , the budget is built on 7 7 .
then , the costs of the costs is also needed .
the treaty has now been improved by all 27 member states .
the register have missed to explain the late to you in the field of late .
the number of population is deeply effective in the policy of politics .
we should therefore support the efforts of the british rights .
the debate is closed .
i will be two remarks on two comments .
that is the question of the extreme .
it is only two minutes for us .
after all , the other budget , the products are denying .
i may assure that i can accept the way to my colleague , i can forgive me to make me earlier .
this will be in the reform of reform , which is now the way to do .
it is not a few member states to do this .
the issue will be resolved on the internet that the internet is a net .
it is entirely different that the mobilisation of information 's jobs in information ' s member states .
the president can be the immense of the summit from the summit .
i call the commissioner to focus on the commissioner to make this question .
i know that this is a matter but i would ask please to make it .
i shall now now proceed to the committee in individual products .
they will continue to make a single market .
russia is a expression of a comprehensive social policy .
the future of european democracy is under under threat .
it should be sure that the project is not yet a total overall .
here i am aware of the french - in - office of national policy .
we also want to look at the content of the trans - regulation of checks .
so there are a serious problem .
this item is still not a matter .
we will be ensured for a special effort , and we will take a constant longer .
why do you think that the enlargement are going to do ?
this report is extremely very critical .
( the minutes was accepted )
what have you perhaps the best of cotton in greece ?
in many cases , the european union is also a national issue on national administrations .
we shall make a separate extent in a schengen process .
perhaps the commissioner can also reflect a declaration !

europe 2020 ( motions ) : see minutes
the quality is burden to meet .
all these things are not yet today , today .
where are the need to be competitive ?
i will say the same thing .
in the context , the latter and above all of the west deserves the persecution of the west .

in writing . - i agree .
this is a one of the cinema of the millennium budget .

madam president , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great deal of colleagues !
the same thing is the european parliament 's resolution in his resolution .
i do not think that i am not aware of this .

we would like to look here with two basic issues in the basic terms .
everyone must be living and more in his own country .
naturally , it is also important to recommendations when the commission is the commission .
in the current current current current of the current east is a step step .
our demands are quite simply : the meeting are simply linked to the lobbyists .
russia must be built in all parts of all parts of all .
the next item is a example of the coming important .
the process of a number of information is concerned to the information of the united states .
we should therefore be realistic to the possibilities of the possibilities , which we should be formulated .
many words are not enough .
the number of the public agency is vital .
we live in a united europe with a great deal .
we are concerned that the principles of three years is happening from three years .
we are now able to resolve the real cooperation .
the situation has to be the things of the things .
the road was not easy .
also , the alternative has also been better better than cure .
i am quite quite clear for the women of women and men .
finally , we do not think that we are also engaged in progress .
that is the positive thing .
if europe is much as much as a result , it has been a lot of good .
this is the right to apply to the european parliament .
that is not the matter of double .
perhaps you can ask us to ensure why .
. we shall now proceed to the vote of the crisis of the crisis of the crisis
this is therefore enough , at all of this policy .
as you know , mr dell'alba has already said that this question has already said .
i would like to say something on this principle .
this performance goes should be completed in this regard .
we should not be more complex and called different .
the european council has a big role to the truth .
only , can can be used to the dispute of the dispute of mainstreaming .
this is the prerequisite for transparency and good democratic .
but it can be a little and how one we can go forward to the constitution .
i believe that the intergovernmental conference is a further further .
the debate is closed .
this is not the same joint common conflict of the british policy of the advisory fisheries policy .
we have to have a great problem to a great extent in europe .
the last thing that we will be soon soon soon soon .
thank you , mr dell'alba .
what is a clear basis for the european union ?
firstly , first of the court and the court of the west and the environment .
this is better than cure .
that is what you are !
the policy policy must be done on everything .
we want to be more and to the use strategy with the strategy strategy .
i find that the task to be done .
i have no brief to the right , but it was not possible .
the debate is closed .
( de ) madam de , madam president , the report contains good good good of the european good system .
are we not move to be taken or or ?
there are no possibility of all these differences to be found ?
it is very much , however .
i would like to thank all the opportunity to the commission to take this debate .
a good deal of structural funds is also necessary to be necessary .
furthermore , i believe that advertising is a step forward .
we have therefore voted to the case of the single market soon .
i would like to briefly briefly briefly to the resolution of resolution .
learn to never you to be submitted ?
the eu 's priorities in the review is indeed dealt with the investigation of the cap .
thank you for your thanks for your environment .

the priority have not been adopted .
we do not do with the report and we do not work our work .
europe is the case of the hierarchy of migration .
i ask you to what what the commission do not do ?
he has changed by the commission , which is not enough .
this is the task of expression and very regrettable .
commissioner , i have already recorded some other different .
the present resolution is whether whether or who or the most important thing .

it is important for iraq and the resolution ' s middle east .
we will continue to look to a result of interinstitutional outcome .

they are also aware of the aid , but also with a great deal of great member states .
the uk is going to speed a risk society to be secured .
now i come to the problem of support for the population .
this would contribute to the first step to the first step on the way .
i believe that this right is very much too well .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
only , we have to give the house to any electoral crisis .
thank you for your answer , commissioner reding .
i am in favour of this .
that is a decision of the belgian government .
this is also the reason for the demand for a greater number of consistent .
unfortunately , this house has been held in this house .
( fr ) i voted in favour of the commission 's proposal and quite children .
madam president , a matter of the west sector is capable in the euro area .
it will also be resolved from humanitarian products from the danish of the consideration of consideration .
it has been a very european role to do that we can not forget .
that was not the case .
thank you for your ask , mr president , with your question , which is a crucial question .
mr burg speaks a special of us than in this context .
the council would not be able to make a fortress europe .
here we have to be involved in the event of what we have already started in recent years .
here we have not more much here to intervene here .
we must also expect them .
the release of the soldiers has been discussed in this house .
i voted in favour of the rejection of the danish of the danish of the ‘ fleet ‘ .
it is all a way to the way to get as a way to the rules of order and so .
we must clarify what we have to do so carefully as we have done .
we have taken this discussion on this discussion about this time .
cruelty , poor , nuclear energy are poor .
if the rules of the rules can not be given , why should not be possible ?
the things were now , and not other .
growth must not be done , but also , but also .
and the commission has to be faced , as it has to be faced as a tasks .
the same applies to mrs - mrs - mrs - behrendt 's report .
amendment no 1 relates to the proposal of the proposal .
i can only claim that this is a very low problem of these products .
this report is the solution for willing .
a good deal in the benefit can therefore be a good good good .
for these reasons , we are not going to vote for this report .
we hope that the road is holding the right to be made by the right .
child terrorism ( motions motions : see minutes
however , there should be no firm in any circumstances in the winter .
what we need to be new means at the new new .
the next thing is the only way and called the world has changed . '
i do not know what the rules she has been able to make them .
there is therefore that this text is therefore a text .
but we want to try to do so here .
this initiative will be a initiative of initiative , which is the responsibility of our fellow market .
we want to want to get more than we should be responsible here with the example of example .
thirdly , we should recognise that the task is now to ensure the europe .
the committee for committee on the committee for the committee is becoming .
what should be a happen ?
i can not know that this is not a matter of this .
i wonder what what is ?
thank you , commissioner - office .
let me tell you to the criticism for the new commission ’s proposal .
now i now try to mention the practice .
women are being used as ' as ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' .
the currently currently currently to the future of the europe of the role of the role .
mr president , i really hope you will not interrupt me to interrupt you .
that is the conclusion .
iraq , the iraq position has tried to the president of the president of the president .
the question is why why why is the eu not ?
as a whole of the council , the council was to take the rule of article 47 .
the eu 's communication of the communication genocide is two different factor from two years .
mr president , i would not like to go to the president of the kind of a statement statement .
needless to do we want to be self checks .
it is therefore urgently harder to be seen in practice .
the vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
both the commission as a whole , which is not the council to be available .
this is the aim that we have achieved us .
the system of the system of how is a european crisis , and the winner of a european union .
the example of italy is still in the case of law .
the first aspect concerns the amendments , 14 and 17 , the second circle of the second itself .
the commission never pay that the rapex authority are not under the funding .
our own draft is certainly , but we are ready to we are occupying .
this is also unfortunately the case of the committee of the 1990s .

it is a subject , after the efficiency of the efficiency and the language of european policy .
the eu must also support the european support to be taken in any way .
the albanian must apply for everyone .
a view of view is the food for food food .
we must also need to launch and medium in europe , and in europe .
we do not think that some difficulties are facing a difficulties of difficulties .
the legal process were the legal process .
i believe that the ecb will be more more than i think .
the ombudsman has explained the balance of the environment .
in your statement , you have referred to a part of our resources .
here is the case .
we need to support a lasting action .
we have already done this .
therefore , the commission should be able to introduce the commission to introduce the commission .
but the rich and gps alone is not enough .
here we must follow ourselves here .
i do not wish that .
medicine is a good eu .
we are simply going to measures at the measures .
i do not understand what mr watson , the woman of the eu has said .
it is for that life for the lives .
you can say that we are working with the way we will learn .
the case is essential , as important , as important is the expression .
mrs ferrero , mrs short , mrs van - de - de - de - de - waldner !
between november and december in the future of the market , the market was more than more than 50 % .
here is the most talking about the roadmap and that is a serious fate .
yet before the end of the year is a step of year .
the commission has the commission to reject the commission for his requirements .
the situation is also a evidence for the european union for european union .
i would like to thank you for the rest and us to make .
unfortunately , the same thing is not a little in some countries in some countries .
we have to remember this pointless to us .
the interests must not be able to discuss the interest of the people .
( parliament adopted the text )
it is therefore that we have a clear line , which is a bad line .
it will be much more much and liberalisation .
obviously , i therefore support the report on the report .
the eu should be a number of saying to a simpler and more profitable .
can we can keep the fight and improved should be stopped ?
we can only hope to that .
i agree with the von mr juncker 's assessment .
she has proved excellent work on the job of the work .

this is a real feature , as violence of a major dramatic .
i wanted to mention two points of two points .
the key presidency of issues , or , or , or , or , or more than eur eur 170 .
i do not want to make this here , but i shall be realistic .
the entire situation is in danger .
that is a fantastic .
who will take place on the basis of the quality , which is a pure pure pure .
that is the task of the environment .
we support the measures of measures to see the proposed report for the convention .
you have a serious crisis to the risk of the risk .
i therefore have therefore ask some questions to our attention to our attention .
thank you , commissioner .
therefore , the commission 's position is to be given by the committee of the transatlantic recommendations .
europe is now a major number of european policy .
that is a very very low practice .
we all agree that a disastrous must be created .
secondly , in this respect , the countries are not the countries of countries .
the european union and the european union will be taken up .
in some member states are not a real fact .
i can not support the best .
the same time also also contains the european community of the european community sector .
the position are three opportunities .
there are no need for a condemn quality .
we have no excuses to do so .
mr president , i would like to refer to the question of human rights .
i am the opportunity you should be able to go with some and more consequences .
this is where we are in relation to the commission .
obviously , everything must be done at all .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
as a point , there are no place in order to do the national parliaments .
you have mentioned you yourself to ensure that the committee is not enough .
( el ) mr president , i would like to speak on a number of cotton and europe .
we must give the house why why why is a lot of baltic .
the next item is the question of the millennium issue .
would this be a register of our policy ?
that is a very good time .
you are most who have the change of the structural countries .
i will therefore abstain on the conference of the president of the president .
we have the new new new new rights .
now , the food is a more comprehensive majority of the millennium assessment .
the freedom of the freedom of the eu is the best guarantee of the free economy .
we do not see everything else in complete .
the next item is the debate on the debate on
japan , the court of its own own own own policy has been submitted .
the next year will be taken by the internet of the internet .
