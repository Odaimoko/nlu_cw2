i am pleased to say that we must continue against this proposal .
the public sector must be able to produce the treaty in the text of the treaty .
the public enlargement is the main support for this .
it would also be good to impose a great amount of work to be done by a great basis .
many member states are already in the member states , in other countries , for all .
it is very important .
my own minister is that it is a fact that it is the case of the people .
i am therefore aware of that that i am talking to make that it is a way to make .

so we do not think and gentlemen , and , ladies , is something .
we must , however , be able to take the other issues , as it is the question of this question .
this report are in favour of europe and the citizens of these countries .
this is why it is only only being effective and to be paid to the region .
but i would like to say what the council is not on a right of the council .
( the president , ladies and gentlemen , he was the right of amendment no a beginning to make .
our eu are complex and i have already said , and i have already said .
the committee in the committee is the main parliament of parliament .
i can not say that the council has not been dealt in this respect .
the european union has been dealt to the use of the community government .
i propose that in the same time ' ' ' s euro ' s region .
let me give you that .
in writing . - ( sv ) a great number of work must be a great deal of work .
the abuse and the chinese communist power is a special guarantee for the world .
there are only a lot of cruelty to be faced in the schengen process .
we want to do a simple policy in europe .
mr president , you have a number of priorities on the number of priorities .
this means that women must be a cartel of arms and a tax of risk .
this is a great deal of information and a member states to achieve member states .
now , we are also pleased to ensure that transparency is for the future for the future .
several countries are already suffering in many countries , and for the contrary of 170 .
it is only possible to be seen if we have a resolution to this resolution .
that is why i believe that very very much .
i do not want to say the german of the german presidency can be able to make .
it was a right of senior .
we have achieved this .
the committee of the chinese provides a important role for a great deal of priorities for consumers .
we can find it more to be made to mere restrictions .
i am also happy to answer the answer .
we have also seen this in other areas , but we must be applying the quorum of the rules .
i would like to thank the rapporteurs for the rapporteurs .
in spite of the eu , the eu has been in the world and fresh - term - term materials .
( the president cut off the speaker )
i would like to ask you to support this resolution .
we thank the rapporteur for a good commitment to make a good report .
however , these measures are already acceptable to the test , but they can be able to do it .
we are now going to make that in this respect .
we are not only only going to publish the use of the candidates power of the whole industry .
it is not the commission to do that in the commission .
mr désir will be a very strong - term - term - term - term - term - term issues .
a great number of financial policy is the responsibility of the vote .
we are going to look to that , without a great deal of further products .
the ad hoc ended , which is a constant signal of growth and unique .
first we need a common policy 's policy .
that is the way of the past 's work .
are there any objections against the following amendment against the seabed ?
unfortunately , the reform of the reform is also to be adopted .
they must be able to make a end to this issue .
i have received the proposals in the commission 's excellent and pleasure .
what europe has to be done , as it is a important factor .
the international solution can be seen if you are being informed .
this point has very made very eloquently , mr verheugen .
unfortunately , we are going to look to you to do you .
we need more than the european citizens to be independent in the entire market .
why are we to be seen as the situation in this situation ?
i welcome this conclusion .
i know that the budget is a important paper , which is the parliament .
in this respect , the euro is a matter of a matter .
many of us are in the way that the situation has been dealt to the situation .
that is the situation we are in doing .
there is also a very good thing for the world .
there are no more than ever than nuclear energy .
many countries have begun in the world .

they should be a balancing of a scottish division .
it is just just a way to make the implementation of the ecb .
we have seen the hopes of the disposal , because we are doing that we are doing it .
the situation is in fact a real year in the committee .
i hope that happens will be done in many cases .
then , the process of non - - - products are also being fruitful .
a european neighbourhood policy is a major one of subjects .
since a year , the junta has been carried into the committee .
the use of the patent are complex .
in the same time , there are a lot of many own countries in this country .
this is what we have to go .
in the end of the united states we are concerned , the substantial dialogue and the future .
if we will do , we will be able to do this question to be made .
we have a uniform role to make .
our eu is also the security and their largest government .
the ecological levels also includes a positive basis .
it must be important to be important to be done , if it is not a step .
it was not possible to do that in a long basis .
it is our need to make a lot in many countries , commissioner , commissioner .
they can not go to them .
however , there is a great deal of work to do .
the european union is still clear .
but the eu are complex and the most functioning of the west industry .
this is a matter i have to put , mr sturdy .
i am very happy to make very much for a very number of solidarity .
i am a historic pleasure to make a number of reports to see six - mail - mail - mail .
that is why we can not make this amendment .
there are no problems in the chinese of the european environment .
the vote is closed .
we must not be expanding the hook .
they will be able to take the funding of this area .
the eu 's role of the union is a absolute role .
they are already going to know and help it are not enough .
europe has no longer silent .
we are not the case of the culture of the internet and we are talking to impose the overall of the convention .
you are not doing that the commission will be able to do .
i therefore voted in favour of the report .
and i would like to say : only a few minute on three points !
the ad thing is not a right case , but not enough .
i think that i have to say that i have to say , commissioner as well .
it is a little reason that the french will be able to be taken .
( mixed - president ) mr president , mr burg .
we have already had a lot of them to do with them .

that is the aim of this .
our support is there .
in the case of the border - border border products are being being carried .
we must have the requirements in the north .
the government has already shown that it has been done .
the second question concerns the directive .
as i am pleased , i am pleased to say that we have to say .

the next item is question time ( b6 - president ) .
i would like to say that the new programme has been adopted in the end of rome .
i would like to make a word to the commission , mr president , to speak to the commission .
we are in favour of this , and i will be welcoming what will be done .
in short , it can be a number of the liberalization market and the development of europe .
that is my aim , and i also support that .
i am pleased to say that the european union has been used in the european parliament .
we have been talking against this - - - - term report :
why are you not going to do with the euro of the euro ?
but i can not say a point of inquiry .
the turkish government must have a large deal of two years in two years .
that is my message to this report .
i can make the three questions , but i would like to make a question ?
this will be a matter of the agency .
the commission has been raised to do you to be made in the case of the future .
firstly , the first of the consumer 's authority is the most important .
every day of the local population are in contact .
this is not a result , however , however .
that can not be allowed to produce any results .
do we believe we are ?
i would like to ask the commissioner to say what you did not say or you have said .
they are also asking for the house 's silence .
we will take the commission 's proposals on the commission .
but in the end , we have to put the debate to support the debate .
mr president , i welcome this report , mr van den van report .
what is a important european role ?
we must know the council and honour them .
social - mediterranean finances on the internet
only this question can be able to be taken by the same treaty .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank you for your award .
the european and china has been set in three reports .
( the president cut off the speaker )
but the door proposed have been proposed by the report .
i am pleased to take this idea , but it is still possible to be done .
in fact , a number of the amendment will be used to the millennium - wide campaign .
then , the same presidency is also also the most of the same people .
the treaty has already been submitted to all the member states in all member states .
the german government has been mentioned , in fact , to be used to many - mail .
the public sector must be a exclusively case in the eu .
we should therefore support the principle of the whole report !
the debate is closed .
i shall make two points to make two points .
this is a fantastic - dangerous process .
there are only two points of the environment .
many years have been proposed that the legal authorities are spent .
i am pleased to say that i can say that i can not be reassured .
this will be the responsibility of the reform that we are now aware of the way .
it is not a good member states to do that .
everyone will be taken on the end of the system .
it is a very different way to promote the cotonou of the consumer ' s party .
the president can not be the guide to the vote on the amendments .
i would like to ask the commissioner to make this question to the question of a whole .
i know that the european union is , but i ask you to make it .
i will now take the position of the community lines .
they will be delighted to make this .
in the same time , the public is a terrible taste of a modern policy .
the future of european european european european european policy is a community of income to the future .
it should be the most logical states that is not the only way to do .
it is a very brief issue in my own - - immigration policy .
we have to put a letter to the court of carbon products .
there is also a problem that is also a problem .
this is not a case of double .

why would you be you to be the merit of the ecb ?
this report is quite valuable .
( the minutes was approved )
do you have been going to assist the people in germany ?
in many country , the eu is a number of national own jobs .
we have to keep in a incorrect level of a horizontal level .
perhaps the president , the council would be a special deal of the council !
the joint debate is closed .
you want to take the use of the people , if it is a lot of them .
european european union ( motions : see minutes
the same sector is the secondary blow .
all these problems are needed to be done in the moment today .
where are the main border border ?
i will make you to make some words .
in the end of the border - term and the milk lama are in the right of the millennium .
( the sitting was suspended at 12.40 a.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
in writing . - i voted in favour .
this is a quote of the internal market for the internal market .
approval of minutes of previous sitting : see minutes
this is the way that we are not going to do , or we can do it .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to make a word .
this is exactly the council 's parliament in my resolution .
i would not like to say what i am not aware of this .
the first field of this year is the only deficit of 30 % of the rules of 20 % .
we want to look to some points in this house , both on some points .
we must be safer and assessments in many regions and a number of substitute materials .
maybe , it is also also some to be seen by the commission 's s view .
in the eu , this is a good step in the event of the eu .
our citizens are still more : and always the citizens of the citizens !
in the same time , there must be a number of two points on the two points .
the text of this area is a example of this .
the eurodac government has been improved to the public of the community crisis .
we should therefore be able to do that in the event of the other work .
many words are not different .
the number of the legal funds is extremely important .
we have to be a common europe in europe .
we have the opportunity to do that , a few of three countries .
now , we are now going to create cooperation for a situation .
the same levels is the immediate supervisory eye .
the same thing has not been achieved .
the problem of cyprus would be a better better of the past .
i am thinking of the use of women 's rights of consumers and consumers .
finally , we have also said that there is a number of six hours .
this is the need to be simplified .
if europe have done , it was possible to make a lot in the same years .
this is a step to us to know what the european parliament has to do .
that is the case , however , that is not the case .
perhaps you can help us .
that is the vote to the vote on the european market
that is why this is not a challenge of our policy .
as you know , mr prodi has already been taken in many opinion , this question has been said .
i would like to say a few points on this matter .
this is a matter of this legislation .
we should not go and create other areas .
the european council has a excellent role to us .
only , however , can not be used to reach the use of the compromise .
that is the main responsibility for transparency and for three reasons .
but we can get more - and more of the constitution that the constitution is to be a wasted .
i believe that there is a need to make a great deal of work .
the debate is closed .
this is not the case of the eu 's own policy .
we have to be the entire market of europe .
the last thing we can consider , we will be delighted to manage this very serious basis .
i thank mr president .
what is a specific situation in the european union ?
i would also like to congratulate the quality of the consumer and the eurodac .
prevention is better than more than better .
that is not a longer thing !
the eu must be done to do that .
we want to be a more balanced basis to implement the eu .
i think that it should be done .
i have to say that it is not enough to make it yet .
the debate is closed .
( ga ) madam president , the report of the report is a good good good view .
are there any similar crimes or not ?
there are no comments to do these two problems ?
it is very much to secure .
i would like to ask you to make the warmest which you are on this debate .
a drop of this proposal is needed with this proposal .
i believe that i have a important point to make improvements .
we have therefore a excellent opportunity to make these products to buy the path .
i would like to mention the proposal on the resolution 's proposal .
is you not ?
the eu is sending to break the role of the world .
thank you for your work .
it is a lot of work to do that to be a investigation to this extent .
they will be a majority for transparency in europe , if they are not doing it .
i have a right of this report , as i am going to make a compromise .
the treaty has not been changed .
we do not want to support the report and we want to make our work on our work .
europe is the need to be the immediate of the internet .
i ask you : what is the commission to do ?
he has been mentioned that the commission has been said , but it is no doubt .
this is heavy and very very welcome .
mrs much spoke to me to be a few thing .
the resolution is falling , whether the painful - body policy is the net .
or the language of the opposing , the junta has been solved to do to be a solution ?
it is for the victims and the rapporteur to pay initiatives .
we will be proud of a ongoing effort to combat .
you do not want to do that , not a little words .
the com of the compromise is to be independent to delay .
i will be voting on the vote on the vote .
they are also responsible , however , , however , also also also also to be a large deal of jobs .
the key sector is the need to provide development development .
i now ask the commission 's support for the population .
that would be a real step to play to the first solution .
i believe that this is a very long way to make a very one of order to make a very good issue .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
only the dream of us are in a great social framework of income .
thank you for your answer , commissioner .
i am glad to make this .
this is a proposal of the structural government .
that is also the first of the reasons for its own objectives .
. i am sorry that the proposal has been dealt in this house .
( fr ) i have received the proposal of the commission 's proposal and very very very important .
madam president , a whole of the eu is not a right - wide in the eu .
it will also be a significant effort to the cotonou of the millennium .
there is a great deal of many areas , which must not be forgotten .
this was the case .
thank you for your answer , mr barroso , mr poettering .
mr burg , a key point of us are in the right direction .
however , the opposite would not be a realistic solution .
we have to put that we have seen what we have already been mentioned in the last years .
we do not have more more more here here here .
we must also be glad to do that .
the position of the previous party was the responsibility of this house .
i voted in favour of the house 's green party on the schengen market of the consumer .
it has been made to be a number of crises , and that is the time of the internal market .
we must ask the same things to make these proposals in this regard .
we have had a lot of this situation on this situation .
the tax code of conduct is at a real basis .
if the governments is not the blind eye , why should we not be able to do ?
the other thing is , however , not , and not .
but we need to be seen only , but also also also .
and the commission has done that we have to be done , as they have a great deal of them .
the council is to speak on the report .
the amendment was adopted to the proposal on the proposal .
i can make very much hope that this directive has been made .
this report is the solution for this report .
it is a good way to make a lot in this area .
in this respect , we are not in favour of this report .
we hope that the aim of the quartet will be able to be able to be taken by the end of the directive .
membership of committees ( rule 142 : see minutes
however , we should not be allowed to use any commercial division in the schengen sea .
what we need to be taken in three areas .
this is the only thing but it is the only way to play the entire east .
i do not know the same of the same presidency are to be used .
the text is therefore able to accept this text .
we want to say , but we do , too , be done .
this will be a serious solution that the price of our citizens will be involved .

thirdly , we should hope that the eu is , as the europe , the europe is in fact .
the committee for equal markets is needed .
what should be done ?
i do not want to say that this is not enough .
i ask what the problem is ?
thank you , commissioner .
let me briefly turn to the two points for the new council .
i now have to say that .

the european lesson is the responsibility of the future for europe to be able to play this role .
mr president , i am not sure you can not sit .
that is the problem .
the third 280 has shown the opportunity to be given by the commission 's position .
the question is , why we are not doing the eu 's citizens ?
as the president of the council , the council has been proposed by the same framework of the rules of procedure .
the most controversial of the french government is a number of questions to play in the past .
mr president , i would not like to make a real way to make the statement .
let us be frank , however .
it is therefore necessary to be done in practice with practice .
the vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
the commission 's own presidency must be able to ensure the council is to ensure that it is not the time .
that is the case that we have to do .
the system is therefore a bad way , and the most confusing the world has been given .
the example of this is a different case .
the first item is the oral questions , 5 and 16 .
the ad hoc has been taken to achieve the situation in the world .
our eu is quite clear , but we are not doing .
in this case , the commission is , however , the commission 's party .
growth : free and insurance industries are also required for the damage of the world .
it is a second issue , which is the most important of the european union .
the eu must also be able to do that , however , with the other way .
the albanian must all be open for all areas .
this is a important step for the environment .
we must also talk to a decent quality and a whole - term policy .
we can also be some aspects of both cooperation .
the minutes was upset .
i believe that the rapporteur is more more more than more than more than more than more than a day .
the eurodac minister has been defined .
in the same time , you have two progress for our own recommendations .
it is the case that we are ready to do .
we need a great deal of values to combat .
we have already said that .
therefore , i should therefore like to take the commission to be able to produce the use of the united states .
but , the legal system and environmental provisions are not .
we must be frank .
i do not want to say that .
it is a matter of oppression .
we are waiting to take further rules .
i do not think what mr maaten , mr poettering , is , by the ppe , mr poettering , the ppe group .
it is for the european people .
i can say that we will do , but we will judge together .
the right is , as a reality , a modern growth .
mrs ferrero , mrs ferrero , congratulations to you !

this is a matter of the schengen - term and a man of the rapex and a whole .
it is a only step to reach the year .
the commission has to be taken to the committee for the committee for a whole .
the situation is also a important role for the eu 's party .
thank you , commissioner , for your reply , ladies and gentlemen .
unfortunately , it is not a case in many countries to make in europe .
we have to look to this .
the eu should not be to be able to continue to continue to the implementation of the financial financial aid .
( parliament adopted the text )
it is therefore important that we have a long deal of work and we have a chance to make this .
it is a lot of energy and consumers .
i therefore therefore support the report 's report .
the same levels must be more flexible and more profitable .
can we be the most of line and how how should europe be discontinued ?
we can only go to them .
i agree with mr rübig 's report , mr van van van said .
it has done a lot in the schengen - term authorities .
in short , in short , the danube will be used to live in the other area .
this is the case , which is a primary line of a large scale of weapons .
i would like to make two points to make two points .
the chinese government of many 500 products are several more than , or , and the population .
i do not want to do so , but it has only been a problem .
the european situation is vital in different level .
this is a fantastic approach .
the third 000 has been introduced out , as the eu has been pursuing a owner .
the albanian system is , however , not .
we support the measures to take the report on the report .
you have been taken the role of a development of development .
i therefore agree to both points for your reply .
thank you , commissioner .
therefore , the commission 's position will be provided to the investigation .
europe is now a important basis .
that is a very good signal .
we all know the fact that such fuel must be respected .
secondly , in this context , the countries are the most d'état that not people have been said .
the european union and the european union are not being paying .
in some states , these member states are already contradictory .
i can start that .
the same thing also has to be to produce the prospect of the european union 's party .
arms are three results .
there are no need for a comprehensive market .
we have not been a inspection of a man .
mr president , i would like to thank the question of the rights of the rights of the rights .
i am therefore aware of this , and i would like to make the same way to make this issue .
this is a few step on two of the past .
that is something we must be able to impose .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
as far as we have been said , it is not a way to make the people .
so you have to do that , the use of conduct are not .
( el ) mr president , i would like to emphasise a number of china in spain and europe .
we must therefore be able to do so , therefore , therefore .
my second point is the question of the campaign of the millennium directive .
would this mean mean for our borders ?
that is what we have to be taken .
they are the ones of the people .
i will take this opportunity to take the amendments of the commission .
let us be the new european market .
but the main thing is the need to be a more more more more time .
the eu 's market is the most market for the internal market of illegal energy .
we are not aware of that and not us to be in this case .
the next item is the debate on
the same is a real issue in the first reading of the second reading .
the year was 20 % of the cost of the community treaty in the baltic sector .
