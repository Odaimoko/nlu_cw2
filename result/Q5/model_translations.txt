my own country , my own concern , that it is a matter of order .
i am confident that here is more low .
these decisions are decisions for the community of consumers .
this applies to the world in our own homes .
this has proved been a well of well .
the rapporteur has also done the last time .
mr president , i am talking about the report of mrs van de report .
this is a great order of member states .
this approach is the case of the eu 's commitment to the next level .

the united states is important , but freedom of people is facing great .
therefore , we have a very strong report on this cover .

this aspect will be a key role to be made in the area of the subject of urgency .

many many people are also very closely and they want to bring .
the vote will take place on thursday .
we are not going to be a positive step to play on this report .
in this context , a body will be conducted in this area and year .
mrs van , i think that mr verheugen should be a answer to your answer .
this is the dishonest verdict .
so we have therefore convince , and we believe that we are talking to say and in order to say .
but our group must be introduced but everyone , as it is a question of whether .
this interests , we are bringing europe and citizens that this countries .
this is a right and right if the need to be able to pay the amendments .
but my council appeal to the council : not from our own policy .
( the ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , he was able to make a right time .
our activities are being said , i have already said , as a citizen .
the civilian of the nepalese parliament is against the supreme parliament .
i can only therefore give the council to insist in this respect .

let me tell you this .
in writing . - ( pt ) a good good - in - office is a good principle of the principle .

mr president , you have to be able to know with the enlargement of enlargement .
this means also a duty of implementation and a pilot use of the use of implementation .
this is a little and more effort to all of these member states .
we are now looking for the future , also for political guidelines for the future .
several parts are already to prevent their lives , and hundreds of the people .
since since it is only more than we have to play a resolution .
therefore , this is why it should be very difficult to be very careful .
i do not see the most of the scottish market .
it was no short .
we have achieved this .
the latter of the benefit of a key crisis for consumers is a important for consumers for consumers .
it can be seen yes to be a viable attitude to be protected with the net .

i would like to thank all for all .
social things are still in the world and the world .
( the president of the president ( the president )
i would call you to support this resolution .
we thank the rapporteur for a good work to a good work .
however , this authorities is not yet to be done as a result of the matter .
we are also ready on that .
we are not only just just about the road of the ability to be taken to the millennium framework .
the commission has not yet the commission 's situation .
mr barroso will be able to give them without without without without without without without .
another means of the agency is the agency against the agency .
together , we are a further watering of further watering .
oh , 500 people , 500 , between simplifying and non - oriented .
firstly , we need a personal responsibility of the common responsibility .
that is the time of problems at the problems .
are there any objections against the committee on this oral oral amendment ?
nobody wants to tie the most aims of this objectives .
they must be able to benefit on the benefit of the benefit .
i voted in favour of the proposals of the council 's directive and welcome them .
what europe has been done , and we are doing it .
the solutions can only be used to give it when they are already .
this point has already been said , mr low .
unfortunately , we are looking to do with you .
we need more more than to move with the crisis of crisis .
why are we all have the same effect , parliament is in this matter ?
i welcome this initiative .
i know that the budget is a subject of the budget , which is the same of the people .
in this respect , the name is bad .
many people are being elected to the country , the situation has been made .
that is the situation with the situation we have done .
in a very long , this also applies to the eu .
there are nothing than the solidarity .
many causes have already spoken of the economic crisis .
this was a fantastic - hoc - border - election - scale , and that should not be reduced .
they should be an complex corporate of a horizontal corporate supply .
it is only a few comment to make this to be welcomed to this attention .
we never never see the same thing , because we are doing we are to do that .
the situation of the situation is already already to be discussed in the conflict of the conflict .
i hope it is a different people in the way that it is a result in the same way .
then , the content of jurisdiction is also vital on the 2000 process .
a european market market is a very good issue of many actions .
yesterday , it was a black to the millennium level of the millennium attacks .
the eurodac data are upset .
the same - based - sized conference in the framework of income is clear in this country .
this must be done .
in the wto , we are examining the specific responsibility and wear a concrete responsibility .
but we will be able to ask this question , however , that question is to be sent to this question .
we have a band of double complex that will be a band .
our primary concerns the reliable and your leadership on their proceedings .
the development development is also a step to a such one .
it must be necessary to introduce a step to be seen if it is not a different .
it was not possible but a few reasons , but not enough .
it is our example in the area , mr commissioner .
they can not can be allowed .
however , we must have a great deal of change .
the european union is therefore little .
but the sugar are among place and the eurodac patent .
this is why i voted in belgium , mr president .
i am very happy to make a very increasingly largest of one .
i had a lot of a whole - border period period was a genuine issue .
therefore , we can not accept amendment no 8 .
six months after the old has not yet been new new .
the vote is closed .
we must remain more happy to go on .
you will us us to the evaluation of this area in this area .
enlargement enlargement the union requires a institutional reform .
they are all need to be done and we do not all support it .
europe has no longer been done without .
we have the case of the berlin wall and we clarified the elimination of the berlin of the berlin wall .
you do not do that will be the commission 's commission can be prepared .
i therefore voted for the report .
i would like to mention that just just to three three work !
this means that the budget is still still , but not more .
i must say that i am in mind of the future , as commissioner .
sometimes could therefore ask whether the commissioners will be taken .
( ro ) mr goodwill )
we have already discussed them to the bitter ones .
i would like to make three attention and three , just just .
this is the condition for this .
our debate is about .
in short - citizens , every citizens are concerned .
we must be iran in iran .
the government has asked that we can be able to vote that .
the second question concerns the exercise .
as i see , i see , however , our attention is quite clear .
a european observatory is a major different .
the next item is question time ( a5 - in - office of the council .
i would like to make the house to know that the aim of the year is a good amount of the transatlantic sector .
mr president , i would like to say a word to the commission , however .
we remain in favour of this case and will be a immediate .
in short , it can be a number of the liberalization and europe of europe .
that is what i also have to assist the liberals to achieve the liberals .
i am not the most of the most points of europe , in europe , in europe .

why do you have not the national reports about the national wto ?
i can not say a blind comment to make .
the current government must be able to assist this very two years .
that is my essence in the moment .
i can not ask three questions or who will take the issue of the issue of the issue ?
this will be the main aspect of the european aspect .
the commission is responsible to its own own country .
firstly , the question of the west between the port between the port .
because of the population are 60 % in the europeans in the past .
this phased can not be allowed to the real people .
that can not be the time of the issues .
are we talk about what we are talking about ?
i would like to hear the commissioner itself to say , or not just said .
it is , however , are a total point of the entire action .
we shall resume the proposals of the commission 's proposals .
but we have to look on the internal procedure .
mr president , i welcome this report , mr dell'alba .
what is a single question to be taken ?
we must get the council and so .
solvency for the death penalty of death
only thus can be the question of procedure .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i thank you for all for all .
the economic and democratic development was in three countries in three countries .
( the president cut off the speaker )
but the eu has been rejected by the dispute of us .
i firmly support this process , even if it will be done .
for 2008 , a direct effort to 7 7 to 7 7 .
then , the costs of the costs is also too much .
the treaty has now been able to all the member states to save the member states .
the un register have to be taken in advance to advance as long as long as long .
the confidence of the population is about the policy of the policy .
we should therefore support the efforts of the information !
the debate is closed .
i shall give you to two observations on two points .
this is the budget .
it is only two minutes to be available .
finally , the european added is that the products are particularly correct .
i am sure i can remember i can remember i can remember i can remember i can remember my views to me .
this will be the reform of the reform which we are now to change the road to the road .
we are not going to do some member states .
tomorrow will be the internet to the internet that the internet is the net soviet .
it is something no different than the mobilisation of information to ‘ the elderly ‘ s ppe of ‘ .
the president can be the speaker to accept the summit from the summit .

they will be taken up to this .
russia is a great deal of a weapons in russia .
the future democracy democracy democracy in the european union .
it should be borne , but not the only basis .
here i have to say that i have a lot of order to make the national policy .
we also have a number of minutes to move .
so there are also a great problem .
this point is still unacceptable .
we will be a point for a competitive and pleasure to cure and evasion .
why do you think that the enlargement will be used ?
this report is extremely very critical .
( the minutes were accepted )
what do you have the exchange suffered in greece ?
many cases should be a great deal of national belgian belgian citizens .
it is important to move in a case of a material material .
maybe , maybe , the commissioner also may play a statement statement !
the joint debate is closed .
you want to bring the sakharov of the temporary who are to be able to bring their leadership .
europe ( continuation ) : see minutes

all these things are not a specific today .

approval of minutes of previous sitting : see minutes
that is the main way which we can be able to find a great deal or one of this .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen ,
this package is proposing the european parliament in his resolution .
i would like to say that i am not like to say : i am not against against .

we want to bear two more carefully to two other issues .
everyone must be seized and more excellent in his own country .
needless to the last thing , it is also a single purpose of the commission , which is the commission .
in category , the current issue is a step step forward .
our demands are quite simply : the lobbyists of the lobbyists is the supreme agenda !
russia must be the situation in all points in all points .
the next thing is a example of example .
the eu 's party should provide a tremendous effect to the public .
we should therefore be able to give the possibilities to interfere together .
many words are not allowed to be displaced and not .
the number of the public takes to be further into .
we live in a united of a united europe .
we have to do that a three years of three years is the best years .
we are now able to resolve the real cooperation .
the committee 's position is the things .
the road was not easy .
i also have a alternative better to be better better .
i am myself for the house for women and who are responsible with the people of women and security .
finally , we are also hoping that there are also ever progress .
that is the positive thing .
if europe is much , as much as far as a result , it has been a lot in general terms .
that is the case of the compromise of the example of the european parliament is doing .
that is not the matter of the matter .
perhaps you can not mean us why .
we now now proceed to the crisis of the crisis of the crisis of the crisis
that is why i am pleased to support this policy .
as you know , mr von , has already said to other a large amount of other manner .
i would like to say something to this point .
this performance - policy service is completed .
we should not be more different and different different .
the european council was a great deal of the european council .
only can only be able to accept the dispute of the dispute of the dispute .
that is the prerequisite for transparency and for good and good .
but we can get a own day , and how is the constitution to the constitution .
i believe that this is a new factor in the text .
the debate is closed .
this is not the same of the common fisheries policy of the budget .
we have to have a duty to a duty in europe .
the last way that we will be very soon soon soon soon .
thank you , mr dell'alba .
what is a clear basis in the european union ?
firstly , firstly , first and evasion .
it is better than cure .
that is what is being successful !
the un policy must be done to change this .
we want to want to be more and must be a blind eye .
i believe it should be clear to be done .
i have no doubt but it has been possible to do so .
the debate is closed .
( de ) madam president , the report contains many good good of many good good .
are there any other or or not ?
are there any possibility , there are no possibility why these two differences ?
it is a very difficult point .
i would like to thank all the problem that the commission has been given to comply with this debate .
a separate funds in this direction is necessary to be necessary .
as a result , i think it is important to be advertising .
we have therefore voted to have a commitment to promote combined soon soon .
i would briefly like to mention the essence of the resolution .
learn you are taking ?
the eu 's priorities of us is in the list of the human rights .
thank you for your sincerely .
better , you have to say that it is not to be done on this way .
they will be more large and competition in europe , when they are living .
i have to start with the right , as i have to say with the compromise .
the majority of the majority have not been approved .
we do not do with the report and we do not work on our legislative legislative legislative work .
europe is the most of the scottish government .
now i ask you to do what about the commission to do ?
he has been aware of the commission 's roadmap , totally enough .
this is a true and very regrettable .
commissioner , commissioner , i have already had some doubt to take .
the present resolution is whether or who are particularly going to strengthen the involvement of the balkans .
what is the main way of the accident , but what is a solution ?
it is the iraq and the middle east put the middle east .
we will continue to continue a result of a result .
you say that we can not do swift - truths - truths - truths .
the community fund must be able to impose the use of existence .
after all , i will vote at the vote on the vote .
they are also absolutely great of the communication , but also with a large response .
the 1999 of the uk is a prior society .
i now turn to the support for the support for the population .
the first step to the first step to a road solution .
i believe that the right long is a good history of good history .
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
only the eu is the principle of the crisis crisis crisis .
thank you for your answer , commissioner reding .
i am confident in favour of this .
that is a decision of the belgian government .
that is also the reason for the reason for a greater support of research .
unfortunately , this will be a majority in this house .
i have heard the report on the commission 's proposal and quite very closely .
madam president , a matter of state is becoming fairly controversial .
it will be a scientific factor to be able to pay from the european parliament .

that was the case .
thank you for your reasons , mr corbett , with the extra issue .
mr cohn speaks a great deal of us than these products in this area .
however , the un thing is not a fortress europe .
here we have to assume what we have already done in recent years .
here we have to have more much here here is the case .
we must also await you .
the release of soldiers has been discussed in this house .
i voted in favour of the rejection of the court of the interim agreement on ‘ ‘ .
so it was all a lot of the people , and so that is the order before the order .
we must ask that what we have to do so .
we have to establish that this could be able to get a lot on this time .
solvency sides are poor level .
if the rules of the rules can not be used ?
things were also so a way to the things and not .
growth must not be seen but also in the case of the treaty .
the commission has offered a mistake to make a high tasks as a tasks of such tasks .
the report applies to mrs - in - office of mrs dell'alba .
the amendment no 1 relates to the convention 's legal proposal .
i can only hope that this is a very difficult matter from this matter .
this report is the solution for the solution .
a great deal of a good deal can therefore be done .
for these reasons , we are not going to vote for this report .
we hope that the situation will be a matter of the law that will be reduced .
child terrorism ( parliament ) : see minutes
however , it should therefore be excluded in the winter of the winter in senior .
what we need to need to be three new new regulations .
this is the only way of the only and that is the world has been put to put the world . '
i do not know that the procedure has been able to make them .
that is why we therefore have to make this text .
we want to try to try to go here .
this will be a initiative to the initiative for our citizens .
we want to eliminate to eliminate , we should be discussing more than the example of example .
thirdly , we should know how the task that europe is now in place .
the committee for committee for us to be changed .
what should be a lot ?
i can not think that this is not this .
i wonder what what is the problem ?
thank you , commissioner .
let me turn to the criticism for the new commission ’s new commission .
now i now give the work .
women are women to participate , creating , knowledge of blue ' - date ' .
the currently currently currently the future of europe , as a whole of the commission .
mr president , i really do not hope you will not interrupt it .
that is the conclusion .
iraq has tried to take the former position of the europass of the president of the president .
the question is why why we do not do the eu in the eu .
as the council has a point of the courts of the rules of article migration .
the eu 's authority of combating is a high factor .
mr president , i would like to make a number of active to the statement of the statement .
naturally , we want to be taken to do .
it is therefore essential to be seen in practice .
the vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
both the commission as also as we have to be able to go on this .
that is the aim of the objective that we have achieved us .
the system is therefore tragic as a whole , and the managing system is a modern .
the example of italy is still in the case .
the first aspect concerns amendments nos 9 , 14 and 17 of the second directive .
the eu never never pay to the other countries of the patent .
our own building is still more than we are using .
this is unfortunately , unfortunately , in this case , sadly , the winner of the west of the west .
fifth : free and non - free - based - based quality also calls for decades .
he is a subject of the efficiency that the efficiency of the european policy will be to european policy .
the eu must also be supporting the case of the european union , which may be a lot of the last strategy .
this must be a long of everyone .
such such matters is the food important .
we must also get a more success and medium in europe .
we shall be a third line with difficulties in this respect .
the truth were a speaker .
i believe that i believe that i do not need more than a more one .
the ombudsman has been mentioned .
in your statement , you have a part of the people of our citizens .
here is the case of us .
we need a specific action to be made .
we have done that .
therefore , the commission should be able to adopt the commission 's s future with the future .
but but the rich are not enough to experience .
here we must follow - here .
i do not wish to me .
medicine - trained is a good eu .
we are simply to go on the measures .
i am not understand what mr watson , mr watson , the woman of the woman has said .
he is the ultimate question for the life .
you can say that we are probably know with us .
the case of the case is how is freedom .

the commission has been addressed for the commission for the council .
the situation is also a little for the european union for the european union .
i would like to answer you and us all everything .
unfortunately , this is not necessarily in some countries in europe , in some other countries .
we are in this area .
the eu must not be able to accept the interests of the people of the people .
( parliament adopted the text )
it is a matter that i have a blind eye to make a blind eye .
it will be much from more than information and liberalisation .
obviously , i therefore have just the report to reject the report .
the right of the policy should be simpler and more profitable .
can it be the ultimate and democrats to do that ?
we can only hope .
i agree with mr von 's minister - accession kinnock .
you has done a point of work to work .
in all , in all , in all , in all other other , the european union is a great deal of europe .

i wanted to make two points on two points .
the soviet 's presidency will be eur active , or and that is necessary .
i do not want to be seen but just the instruments .
the entire situation is in the entire situation .
this is a black .
who will take a huge strategy of the world , which is a pure stock .
however , this is a point of concern .
we support the measures of measures to take the proposed report for the council .
you have the risk of a crisis of a crisis of crisis .
i therefore ask my questions to the answer on our attention .
thank you , commissioner .
therefore , the process of the committee 's leadership is to be given by the committee of the transatlantic recommendations .
europe is now a major role of a european research .
this is a very complex level .
we all have to look to the vote that represents a tax extent .
secondly , in this context , the countries are not the countries of the countries .
the european union will be required to the european union .
in some member states are asking in some member states .
i can not agree to the best reports .
the same time is also in the european community community law .
the position are three results .
there are no excuses for a whole - term quality .
we have no excuses to make no power - term - term - term - term - term - building - building truly .
mr president , i would like to refer to the question of human rights .
i am confident you to make that i should like to ensure that you should be able to follow this .
this is where the importance of these importance in two importance is in the importance of the importance .
obviously , everything must be done to prevent .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
as usual , in fact , the national parliaments are not a national role .
you have tried you to ensure that the committee of the committee is not enough .
( el ) mr president , i would like to speak on greece and europe .
we must give why why why why why the new methods have been a great deal .
the next item is the question of the millennium of fuel .

that must be said .
you are it to the change of the structural .
i will take the conference of the conference of presidents on the conference of presidents .
we have regulated the new new portfolio .
the public sector is now a more more than more than a more concept .

the next item is the debate on
japan , the court of conduct is currently the second price for the second sea .
the negotiations of the need to be protected in the internet , all of the internet .
